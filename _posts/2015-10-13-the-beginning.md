This space is my attempt to collect all that I have learned, am learning, and will learn about "Software Eating The World."

I've been hacking away at various projects and teams at an amazing super fast growth start up, that I joined right as we began serious ramp up.

These are my recollections of the hustle, the struggle, and the addictive drug of growth.

Stay tuned.
